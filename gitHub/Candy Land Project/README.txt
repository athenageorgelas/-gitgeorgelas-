ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is an interractive online simulation of the board game "Candy Land". 
The players weave through the colorful tiles, competing to reach the candy castle.
Throughout their journey, the players encounter a number of different random events. These
events include calamities, hidden treasures, special tiles, and the wrath of their opponents.
Players have various possible actions like using candy against their opponent and themselves, playing
rock, paper, scissors, solving riddles, and many others. Players must keep track of their personal
stats and ensure that their stamina does not drop to zero! 

Enjoy!
